<p>I went on vacation with my family here as a teenager. This was the first time I had ever seen the ocean.</p>

<p>New Orleans</p>

<p>I went to New Orleans with friends. We spent a few late nights on Bourbon Street, then had Beignets with coffee for breakfast.</p>

<p>Cumberland Gap</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I spent time here at a bed and breakfast for our anniversary. The small town contained a wealth of history, along with beautiful scenery.</p>
